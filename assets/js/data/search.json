The album was self-produced by Pink Floyd at their Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions that made up their previous works such as Meddle (1971), and Wish You Were Here (1975).Animals is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. The album is loosely based on George Orwell’s 1945 novel Animal Farm, which depicts a dystopian society where animals overthrow their human oppressors and establish a totalitarian regime. The album divides the human society into three classes: the dogs, who represent the ruthless and greedy businessmen and politicians; the pigs, who represent the corrupt and manipulative leaders and ideologues; and the sheep, who represent the oppressed and exploited masses. The album also features some of Pink Floyd’s most experimental and avant-garde sounds, such as synthesizers, tape loops, and sound effects.The album consists of five tracks, four of which are longer than ten minutes. The album opens with “Pigs on the Wing 1”, a short and acoustic song that serves as a prologue to the album.

The song also features some of the most experimental and avant-garde sounds in the album, such as synthesizers, tape loops, and sound effects, as well as some of the most iconic images, such as the inflatable pig that floats between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station on the album cover.The album then shifts to “Sheep”, a 10-minute track that portrays the sheep, the oppressed and exploited masses who blindly follow the pigs and the dogs. The song is sung by Gilmour, who delivers a passionate and emotional performance, as he sings about the plight and the rebellion of the sheep. The song also features some of the most melodic and catchy sounds in the album, such as the piano, the organ, and the guitar, as well as some of the most surprising and shocking moments, such as the modified version of Psalm 23 that replaces the Lord with the dog, and the sound of the sheep killing the dog at the end of the song.The album closes with “Pigs on the Wing 2”, a short and acoustic song that serves as an epilogue to the album. The song is sung by Waters, who reprises the theme of love and compassion from the first song, and expresses his gratitude and relief for having someone to share his life with in a cruel and hostile world. The song also provides a contrast and a balance to the rest of the album, which is mostly dark and cynical.The album received mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its concept, lyrics, and music, and others criticizing its length, complexity, and harshness.

This post primarily serves an introduction, and as an FAQ. This blog is primarily a hobby effort, as this has been something which I have wanted to start for a long time. Music is a huge part of my life, and I have always been someone who loves to deep dive into things, and analyze them; a trait which has naturally carried over to music. As a result, I have finally decided to tick this item off of my bucket list, and to start this website. I’m happy to have you here with me on this journey, and please, feel free to reach out to me through any of my social media links, in regards to questions, concerns, suggestions, or anything else. I am happy to help, or to just have a conversation 😀!Who am I?My name is Omar Anwar, but most people call me just by my last name, Anwar. I am a student, a software developer, and a huge music fan. My journey with music has not traditional, as I only really started listening to music over the past few years. However, as soon as I started, I was hooked. I loved everything about music, from all of the different emotions that different songs can bring up, to the intricacies and detailed proccess behind music creation and production. Since then, music has become one of the most important part of my life, as atested by the fact that I am too ashamed to share my listening hours for last year, out of fear of looking like I do nothing all day but listen to music. Outside of music, I’m also a big sports fan, both watching, and playing sports, such as basketball, football (both regular and american), baseball, and ufc. I also love to box, and to be outdoors.FAQQ: How often will reviews appear? A: Although there is no strict schedule for when reviews will be posted, in general, you can expect between 1-3 reviews per week, depending on the amount of free time I have during a given week.Q: What type/genres of music will you be reviewing? A: As is stated in the about section, I am someone who is extremly pationate about all types of music, and love to explore all different genres of music. As such, the reviews on here will reflect that sentiment. Reviews will encompass all types and genres of music, from traditonal mainstream stuff, to more underground or experimental records.Q: Where does the name 19tracks come from? A: I would love to have some sophisticated reasoning behind the name, however, in reality, the two parts of the name are pretty straightforward. Back when I played sports, my jersey number, aswell as my lucky number, was always 19. Then, the tracks is obviously because we review tracks. There were a few other names under consideration, however, whether it be to avoid confusion with another entity, or because they were not a right fit, they were not chosen.End SceneEnough with the formalities already! Thanks again for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy your time here. Keep on the look out for new reviews, as they are always in the works, and posted as soon as I am able to bumble over my words and write something which is actually worth reading." } ]
