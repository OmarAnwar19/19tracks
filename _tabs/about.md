Hey 👋! I'm Omar Anwar, but most people just call me by my last name, Anwar. I started this blog because of my passion of music, aswell as analysing and reviewing all aspects of music. I won't be posting reviews of solely the newest records, but rather whatever I am listening to at the time, whether that be the newest releast of the week, or something from 1995.

Hope you stick along for the ride! Cheers 🍻!
