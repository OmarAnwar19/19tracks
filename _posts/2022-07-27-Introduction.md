# Hey ðŸ‘‹!

Thanks for checking out 19tracks, and for being part of something great! This post primarily serves an introduction, and as an FAQ. This blog is primarily a hobby effort, as this has been something which I have wanted to start for a long time. Music is a huge part of my life, and I have always been someone who loves to deep dive into things, and analyze them; a trait which has naturally carried over to music. As a result, I have finally decided to tick this item off of my bucket list, and to start this website. I'm happy to have you here with me on this journey, and please, feel free to reach out to me through any of my social media links, in regards to questions, concerns, suggestions, or anything else. I am happy to help, or to just have a conversation ðŸ˜€!

### Who am I?

My name is Omar Anwar, but most people call me just by my last name, Anwar. I am a student, a software developer, and a huge music fan. My journey with music has not traditional, as I only really started listening to music over the past few years. However, as soon as I started, I was hooked. I loved everything about music, from all of the different emotions that different songs can bring up, to the intricacies and detailed proccess behind music creation and production. Since then, music has become one of the most important part of my life, as atested by the fact that I am too ashamed to share my listening hours for last year, out of fear of looking like I do nothing all day but listen to music. Outside of music, I'm also a big sports fan, both watching, and playing sports, such as basketball, football (both regular and american), baseball, and ufc. I also love to box, and to be outdoors.

## FAQ

Q: How often will reviews appear?

> A: Although there is no strict schedule for when reviews will be posted, in general, you can expect between 1-3 reviews per week, depending on the amount of free time I have during a given week.

Q: What type/genres of music will you be reviewing?

> A: As is stated in the about section, I am someone who is extremly pationate about all types of music, and love to explore all different genres of music. As such, the reviews on here will reflect that sentiment. Reviews will encompass all types and genres of music, from traditonal mainstream stuff, to more underground or experimental records.

Q: Where does the name 19tracks come from?

> A: I would love to have some sophisticated reasoning behind the name, however, in reality, the two parts of the name are pretty straightforward. Back when I played sports, my jersey number, aswell as my lucky number, was always 19. Then, the tracks is obviously because we review tracks. There were a few other names under consideration, however, whether it be to avoid confusion with another entity, or because they were not a right fit, they were not chosen.
