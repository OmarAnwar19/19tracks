# ORQUÍDEAS by Kali Uchis

ORQUÍDEAS is the fourth studio album and second Spanish-language album by Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis, released on January 12, 2024, by Geffen Records. The album features guest appearances by Peso Pluma, El Alfa, JT, Karol G and Rauw Alejandro. Production was handled by Uchis herself, Sir Dylan, Sevn Thomas, Rami, and Raphael Saadiq, among others.

ORQUÍDEAS is a dazzling album that showcases Kali Uchis' versatility and creativity as a young R&B star. The album features a mix of R&B, reggaeton, pop, synth-pop, and dream pop, with influences from Madonna, Prince, and Michael Jackson. The album's themes mainly include love, lust, empowerment, and self-expression. The album also serves as a follow-up to Uchis' previous album, Red Moon in Venus (2023), and is also her first project to be released under Geffen Records after leaving her independent label, Golden Child Recordings.

The album consists of 14 tracks, most of which are shorter than four minutes. The album opens with "¿Cómo Así?", a smooth and sensual track that features a sample of the 1986 R&B song "Nite and Day" by Al B. Sure!. The track is produced by Uchis herself, who provides a mellow and seductive beat that matches her vocals. Uchis delivers a confident and flirtatious performance, as she sings about her attraction, her curiosity, and her desire for a new lover.

The album then continues with "Me Pongo Loca", a catchy and upbeat track that features a sample of the 1987 pop song "La Isla Bonita" by Madonna. The track is produced by Sir Dylan, who provides a bouncy and cheerful beat that contrasts Uchis' vocals. Uchis delivers a playful and charismatic performance, as she sings about her excitement, her happiness, and her appreciation for life.

The album then slows down with "Igual Que Un Ángel", a smooth and romantic track that features a guest verse from Mexican singer Peso Pluma. The track is produced by Sevn Thomas, who provides a mellow and soothing beat that complements Uchis' vocals. Uchis and Peso Pluma deliver a heartfelt and harmonious performance, as they sing about their love, their devotion, and their admiration for each other. The track debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.

Orquideas is a must-listen for any fan of Latin music, and a classic album that showcases Kali Uchi's creativity, skill, and vision. The album is a feast of catchy and clever lyrics, their diverse and eclectic beats, and their harmonious and expressive vocals.
