# African Giant by Burna Boy

African Giant is the fourth studio album by Nigerian singer-songwriter Burna Boy, released on July 26, 2019, by Spaceship Entertainment, Bad Habit, Atlantic Records and Warner Music. The album is a mixture of Afrobeats, Afrobeat, dancehall, pop and hip hop, with influences from Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, and Angélique Kidjo. The album's themes mainly include the resilience and strength of Africa, as well as love, romance, and self-discovery.

The album consists of 19 tracks, most of which are shorter than four minutes. The album showcases Burna Boy's versatility, as he switches between different languages, genres, and moods. The album also features guest appearances from Zlatan Ibile, Jorja Smith, Jeremih, Serani, M.anifest, Damian Marley, and Future.

The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Burna Boy's vocals, melodies, and messages. The album was also a commercial success, reaching number 16 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 104 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album also spawned five singles, "Dangote", "Anybody", "Pull Up", "Gum Body", and "Omo".

African Giant is a must-listen for any fan of Afrobeats, and a solid album that showcases Burna Boy's talent and potential as a young African star. The album features a blend of Afrobeats, Afrobeat, dancehall, pop and hip hop, with influences from Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, and Angélique Kidjo. The album's themes mainly include the resilience and strength of Africa, as well as love, romance, and self-discovery.

However, the album is not without its flaws. Some of the tracks sound too similar, and some of the features do not add much value. The album could have been more cohesive and consistent, and some of the songs could have been shorter or cut. The album also lacks some of the originality and innovation that Burna Boy displayed on his previous album, Outside.
