# MM.. FOOD by MF Doom

!MM.. FOOD album cover

MM.. FOOD is the fifth studio album by British-American rapper and producer MF Doom, released on November 16, 2004, by Rhymesayers Entertainment. The album is an anagram of M.F. DOOM, and a concept album about food and its metaphors in the street world and the nutritional realm. The album features guest appearances from Count Bass D, Angelika, 4ize and Mr. Fantastik, and production from MF Doom, Madlib, Count Bass D and PNS.

MM.. FOOD is a delicious and satisfying feast of hip hop, and one of the most unique and creative albums of MF Doom. The album showcases MF Doom's witty and clever wordplay, his diverse and eclectic beats, and his humorous and quirky samples. The album is also a tribute to MF Doom's influences, such as Princess Diana, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of MF Doom's most personal and introspective songs, such as "Deep Fried Frenz", "Kon Karne" and "Vomitspit".

The album consists of 15 tracks, most of which are named after food items or dishes. The album starts with "Beef Rap", a hard-hitting and aggressive track that features a sample of the 1974 funk song "Hihache" by Lafayette Afro Rock Band. The track is produced by MF Doom, who provides a gritty and funky beat that matches MF Doom's vocals. MF Doom delivers a confident and charismatic performance, as he raps about his skills, his rivals, and his beefs. He also references his alter egos, such as Viktor Vaughn and King Geedorah.

The album then continues with "Hoe Cakes", a catchy and playful track that features a sample of the 1988 rap song "Superappin'" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The track is produced by MF Doom, who provides a bouncy and upbeat beat that contrasts MF Doom's vocals. MF Doom delivers a humorous and clever performance, as he raps about his attraction, his seduction, and his deception of women. He also references his comic book influences, such as Spider-Man and Doctor Doom.

The album then slows down with "Potholderz", a smooth and soulful track that features Count Bass D, a rapper and producer from Tennessee. The track is produced by Count Bass D, who provides a jazzy and mellow beat that samples the 1975 soul song "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby" by Barry White. The track is a collaboration between MF Doom and Count Bass D, who rap and sing about their love for music, their respect for each other, and their disdain for the industry. They also reference their musical influences, such as Kool Keith and De La Soul.

The album then picks up the pace with "One Beer", a banger that features a sample of the 1973 rock song "Hocus Pocus" by Focus. The track is produced by Madlib, a rapper and producer from California, who provides a fast and energetic beat that samples the yodeling, the flute, and the guitar from the original song. The track is a solo performance by MF Doom, who raps about his drinking, his rhyming, and his scheming. He also references his cartoon influences, such as Scooby-Doo and The Flintstones.

The album then closes with "Kookies", a melodic and catchy track that features a sample of the 1970 pop song "The Windmills of Your Mind" by Dusty Springfield. The track is produced by MF Doom, who provides a sweet and soothing beat that samples the vocals, the piano, and the harp from the original song. The track is a solo performance by MF Doom, who raps about his addiction, his satisfaction, and his evasion of cookies, which are a metaphor for internet pornography. He also references his culinary influences, such as Chef Boyardee and Betty Crocker.

The album received universal acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising MF Doom's concept, lyrics, and music. The album was also a commercial success, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, and number 9 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart. The album also spawned two singles, "One Beer" and "Hoe Cakes".

MM.. FOOD is a must-listen for any fan of hip hop, and a classic album that showcases MF Doom's creativity, skill, and vision.
