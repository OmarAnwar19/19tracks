# Animals by Pink Floyd

Animals is the tenth studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on January 21, 1977, by Harvest Records and Columbia Records. The album was self-produced by Pink Floyd at their Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions that made up their previous works such as Meddle (1971), and Wish You Were Here (1975).

Animals is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. The album is loosely based on George Orwell's 1945 novel Animal Farm, which depicts a dystopian society where animals overthrow their human oppressors and establish a totalitarian regime. The album divides the human society into three classes: the dogs, who represent the ruthless and greedy businessmen and politicians; the pigs, who represent the corrupt and manipulative leaders and ideologues; and the sheep, who represent the oppressed and exploited masses. The album also features some of Pink Floyd's most experimental and avant-garde sounds, such as synthesizers, tape loops, and sound effects.

The album consists of five tracks, four of which are longer than ten minutes. The album opens with "Pigs on the Wing 1", a short and acoustic song that serves as a prologue to the album. The song is sung by Roger Waters, the bassist and lead songwriter of the band, and expresses his hope for love and compassion in a cruel and hostile world. The song is followed by "Dogs", a 17-minute epic that depicts the life and downfall of a dog, a ruthless and greedy businessman who exploits and betrays others for his own gain. The song is sung by David Gilmour, the guitarist and co-lead vocalist of the band, and features some of his most impressive guitar solos and vocals. The song also features some of the most complex and intricate arrangements and transitions in the album, as well as some of the most dark and cynical lyrics.

The album then continues with "Pigs (Three Different Ones)", a 12-minute track that exposes and mocks the pigs, the corrupt and manipulative leaders and ideologues who deceive and manipulate the masses for their own agenda. The song is sung by Waters, who delivers a scathing and sarcastic performance, as he targets three different types of pigs: a religious hypocrite, a moral crusader, and a political tyrant. The song also features some of the most experimental and avant-garde sounds in the album, such as synthesizers, tape loops, and sound effects, as well as some of the most iconic images, such as the inflatable pig that floats between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station on the album cover.

The album then shifts to "Sheep", a 10-minute track that portrays the sheep, the oppressed and exploited masses who blindly follow the pigs and the dogs. The song is sung by Gilmour, who delivers a passionate and emotional performance, as he sings about the plight and the rebellion of the sheep. The song also features some of the most melodic and catchy sounds in the album, such as the piano, the organ, and the guitar, as well as some of the most surprising and shocking moments, such as the modified version of Psalm 23 that replaces the Lord with the dog, and the sound of the sheep killing the dog at the end of the song.

The album closes with "Pigs on the Wing 2", a short and acoustic song that serves as an epilogue to the album. The song is sung by Waters, who reprises the theme of love and compassion from the first song, and expresses his gratitude and relief for having someone to share his life with in a cruel and hostile world. The song also provides a contrast and a balance to the rest of the album, which is mostly dark and cynical.

The album received mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its concept, lyrics, and music, and others criticizing its length, complexity, and harshness. The album was also a commercial success, reaching number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. The album also spawned no singles, but was promoted by the In the Flesh tour, which featured elaborate stage effects and performances. The tour also inspired the band's next album, The Wall (1979), which was another concept album that dealt with themes of isolation and alienation.

Animals is a masterpiece of progressive rock, and one of the most influential and important albums of Pink Floyd. The album is a showcase of the band's creativity, skill, and vision, as well as their social and political awareness and commentary. The album is a journey through the band's life, thoughts, and feelings, as well as a reflection of the state of the society and the world in the late 1970s.
