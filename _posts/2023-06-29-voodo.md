# Voodoo by D'Angelo

!Voodoo album cover

Voodoo is the second studio album by American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo, released on January 25, 2000, by Virgin Records. D'Angelo recorded the album during 1998 and 1999 at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with an extensive line-up of musicians associated with the Soulquarians musical collective. Produced primarily by the singer, Voodoo features a loose, groove-based funk sound and serves as a departure from the more conventional song structure of his debut album, Brown Sugar (1995). Its lyrics explore themes of spirituality, love, sexuality, maturation, and fatherhood.

Voodoo is a masterpiece of neo soul, and one of the most influential and important albums of the genre. The album showcases D'Angelo's versatility, lyricism, and emotion, as well as his musical influences, such as Prince, Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Fela Kuti, and Jimi Hendrix. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of D'Angelo's most personal and introspective songs, such as "The Root", "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", and "Africa".

The album consists of 13 tracks, most of which are longer than five minutes. The album opens with "Playa Playa", a funky and upbeat track that features a sample of the 1974 soul song "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby" by Barry White. The track is produced by D'Angelo, who provides a groovy and catchy beat that matches his vocals. D'Angelo delivers a confident and charismatic performance, as he sings about his attraction, his seduction, and his satisfaction of women. He also references his musical influences, such as Prince and James Brown.

The album then continues with "Devil's Pie", a hard-hitting and aggressive track that features a sample of the 1998 rap song "Hip Hop" by Dead Prez. The track is produced by DJ Premier, a legendary hip hop producer, who provides a gritty and dark beat that contrasts D'Angelo's vocals. D'Angelo delivers a scathing and sarcastic performance, as he raps about his disdain for the materialistic and superficial aspects of the music industry and the society. He also references his spiritual influences, such as the Bible and the Quran.

The album then slows down with "The Line", a smooth and soulful track that features a sample of the 1971 soul song "Juicy Fruit (Disco Freak)" by Mtume. The track is produced by D'Angelo, who provides a mellow and soothing beat that complements his vocals. D'Angelo delivers a heartfelt and emotional performance, as he sings about his struggles, his doubts, and his faith. He also references his personal influences, such as his son and his father.

The album then picks up the pace with "Chicken Grease", a catchy and playful track that features a sample of the 1979 funk song "Slide" by Slave. The track is produced by D'Angelo, who provides a bouncy and upbeat beat that contrasts his vocals. D'Angelo delivers a humorous and clever performance, as he sings about his love for music, his respect for his peers, and his disdain for his critics. He also references his cultural influences, such as the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Power movement.

The album then closes with "Africa", a melodic and catchy track that features a sample of the 1974 soul song "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby" by Barry White. The track is produced by Raphael Saadiq, a neo soul singer and producer, who provides a sweet and soothing beat that samples the vocals, the piano, and the harp from the original song. The track is a solo performance by D'Angelo, who sings about his heritage, his identity, and his pride. He also references his ancestral influences, such as Africa and the African diaspora.

The album received universal acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising D'Angelo's concept, lyrics, and music. The album was also a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 320,000 copies in its first week. The album also spawned five singles, including the hit single "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", whose music video garnered D'Angelo mainstream attention and controversy.

Voodoo is a must-listen for any fan of soul music, and a classic album that showcases D'Angelo's creativity, skill, and vision. The album is a feast of D'Angelo's versatility, lyricism, and emotion, as well as his musical, spiritual, personal, cultural, and ancestral influences. The album is also a journey through D'Angelo's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of his growth as an artist and a person.
