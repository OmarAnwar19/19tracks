# Puberty 2 by Mitski

Puberty 2 is the fourth studio album by American indie rock singer-songwriter Mitski, released on June 17, 2016, by Dead Oceans. The album is a follow-up to her 2014 album Bury Me at Makeout Creek, which received universal acclaim from critics. The album features no guest appearances, and was produced by Mitski and Patrick Hyland. The album was mainly recorded at Acme Studios in Westchester, New York.

Puberty 2 is a stunning showcase of Mitski's versatility, lyricism, and emotion. The album explores various themes such as longing, love, depression, alienation, and racial identity. The album also pays homage to Mitski's influences, such as Princess Diana, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of Mitski's most personal and introspective songs, such as "Happy", "Your Best American Girl", and "A Burning Hill".

The album is not a collection of individual songs, but a unified whole that demands to be listened to from start to finish. The album takes the listener on a journey through Mitski's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of her growth as an artist and a person. The album is also a commentary on the state of modern society, and the challenges and struggles that people face in a world that is often indifferent and cruel.

The album is not for the faint of heart, as it confronts some of the darkest and most painful aspects of human nature and experience. The album is also not for the casual listener, as it requires attention and patience to fully appreciate its complexity and depth. The album is, however, for the adventurous and curious listener, who is willing to explore new and unfamiliar territories of music and emotion. The album is a rewarding and enriching experience, that will leave the listener breathless and speechless.
