Production was handled by 21 Savage himself, Metro Boomin, London on da Track, Scribz Riley, Allen Ritter, OG Parker, Cardo, FnZ, and Honorable C.N.O.T.E., among others.

american dream is a powerful album that showcases 21 Savage's growth and maturity as a young hip hop star. The album features a blend of hip hop and gospel music, with influences from Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Tupac Shakur. The album's themes mainly include success, faith, family, and immigration. The album also serves as a soundtrack to 21 Savage's biopic film of the same name, which will be released on July 4, 2024.

The album consists of 15 tracks, most of which are shorter than four minutes. The album opens with "american dream", a triumphant and inspirational track that features a sample of the 2004 gospel song "He Reigns (Awesome God)" by Kirk Franklin. The track is produced by 21 Savage himself, who provides a grand and uplifting beat that matches his vocals. 21 Savage delivers a confident and ambitious performance, as he raps about his journey, his achievements, and his vision. He also references his British origin, his American citizenship, and his deportation case.

The album then continues with "all of me", a catchy and melodic track that features a guest verse from Doja Cat. The track is produced by London on da Track, who provides a bouncy and cheerful beat that contrasts 21 Savage's vocals. 21 Savage and Doja Cat deliver a playful and flirtatious performance, as they rap and sing about their attraction, their chemistry, and their relationship.

The album then slows down with "redrum", a dark and gritty track that features a sample of the 1980 horror film The Shining. The track is produced by Metro Boomin, who provides a sinister and menacing beat that complements 21 Savage's vocals. 21 Savage delivers a ruthless and aggressive performance, as he raps about his enemies, his violence, and his revenge. He also references his infamous knife tattoo, his murder charge, and his rap rivals.

The album then picks up with "pop ur shit", a fast and energetic track that features a guest verse from Young Thug. The track is produced by OG Parker, who provides a catchy and lively beat that matches the vocals. 21 Savage and Young Thug deliver a boastful and arrogant performance, as they rap about their wealth, their fame, and their lifestyle.

The album then slows down again with "letter to my brudda", a smooth and emotional track that features 21 Savage rapping about his brother, who was killed in a shooting. The track is produced by Allen Ritter, who provides a sad and touching beat that matches 21 Savage's vocals. 21 Savage delivers a heartfelt and sincere performance, as he raps about his grief, his guilt, and his memories. He also dedicates the track to his brother, and expresses his love and gratitude for him.

American Dream is a decent album for any fan of hip hop, and a typical project for 21 Savage. The album is a showcase of 21's versatility, lyricism, and emotion, but also of his inconsistency, redundancy, and lack of originality.
