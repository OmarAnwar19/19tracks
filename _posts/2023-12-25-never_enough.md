# NEVER ENOUGH by Daniel Caesar

First of all, merry christmas! Now, let's get into the review.

NEVER ENOUGH is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Daniel Caesar, released on April 7, 2023, by Republic Records. The album features guest appearances by Peso Pluma, El Alfa, JT, Karol G and Rauw Alejandro. Production was handled by Caesar himself, Zachary Simmonds (his younger brother), Sir Dylan, Sevn Thomas, Rami, and Raphael Saadiq, among others.

NEVER ENOUGH is a stunning album that showcases Daniel Caesar's talent and potential as a young R&B star. The album features a blend of R&B, soul, pop, and folk music, with influences from Michael Jackson, Usher, and R. Kelly. The album's themes mainly include love, romance, heartbreak, and self-discovery. The album also serves as a follow-up to Caesar's previous album, Case Study 01 (2019), and is also his first project to be released under Republic Records after leaving his independent label, Golden Child Recordings.

The album consists of 15 tracks, most of which are shorter than four minutes. The album opens with "Ocho Rios", a smooth and soulful track that features a sample of the 1972 soul song "I'm Still in Love with You" by Al Green. The track is produced by Caesar himself, who provides a mellow and soothing beat that matches his vocals. Caesar delivers a heartfelt and emotional performance, as he sings about his longing, his nostalgia, and his regret for a past lover. He also references his Jamaican heritage, as Ocho Rios is a town on the north coast of Jamaica.

The album then continues with "Valentina", a catchy and upbeat track that features a sample of the 1983 pop song "Holiday" by Madonna. The track is produced by Sir Dylan, who provides a bouncy and cheerful beat that contrasts Caesar's vocals. Caesar delivers a confident and charismatic performance, as he sings about his attraction, his admiration, and his appreciation for a new lover. He also references his musical influences, such as Prince and Michael Jackson.

The album then slows down with "Toronto 2014", a smooth and nostalgic track that features a sample of the 2014 rap song "0 to 100 / The Catch Up" by Drake. The track is produced by Sevn Thomas, who provides a mellow and melancholic beat that complements Caesar's vocals. Caesar delivers a heartfelt and introspective performance, as he sings about his struggles, his doubts, and his dreams. He also pays tribute to his hometown, Toronto, and his friend and collaborator, Mustafa, who also provides vocals on the track.

The album then picks up the pace with "Let Me Go", a catchy and energetic track that features a sample of the 1984 pop song "Let's Go Crazy" by Prince. The track is produced by Rami, who provides a bouncy and upbeat beat that matches Caesar's vocals. Caesar delivers a confident and charismatic performance, as he sings about his freedom, his fun, and his flings. He also references his hobbies, his habits, and his humor.

The album then closes with "Unstoppable", a melodic and catchy track that features a sample of the 1985 pop song "Don't You (Forget About Me)" by Simple Minds. The track is produced by Raphael Saadiq, who provides a sweet and soothing beat that samples the vocals, the guitar, and the drums from the original song. The track is a solo performance by Caesar, who sings about his happiness, his optimism, and his positivity. He also references his goals, his dreams, and his legacy.

The album received universal acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising Caesar's concept, lyrics, and music. The album was also a commercial success, debuting at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 85,000 copies in its first week. The album also spawned four singles, including the Billboard Hot 100 number one "Let Me Go".
