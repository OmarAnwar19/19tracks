# The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We by Mitski

!The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We album cover

The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We is the seventh and final studio album by American singer-songwriter Mitski, released on September 15, 2023, by Dead Oceans. The album is a follow-up to her 2022 album Laurel Hell, which received universal acclaim from critics. The album is named after a sign that Mitski saw while driving to rural Pennsylvania, where she lived for a year and encountered religious fanaticism, betrayal, and isolation. The album features no guest appearances, and was produced by Mitski and Seth Manchester. The album was mainly recorded at Machines with Magnets studio in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, using traditional instruments such as piano, banjo, cello, organ, bells, and psaltery.

The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We is a haunting and harrowing masterpiece of avant-garde music, and a testament to Mitski's talent and vision. The album explores various themes such as faith, sin, judgment, redemption, and violence. The album also draws from Mitski's influences, such as classical music, Appalachian folk music, and evangelical hymns. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of Mitski's most powerful and expressive vocals, ranging from angelic singing to demonic screaming.

The album is not a collection of individual songs, but a unified whole that demands to be listened to from start to finish. The album takes the listener on a journey through Mitski's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of her growth as an artist and a person. The album is also a commentary on the state of America, and the world, in the 21st century, and the challenges and struggles that people face in a society that is often inhospitable and hostile.

The album is not for the faint of heart, as it confronts some of the darkest and most disturbing aspects of human nature and experience. The album is also not for the casual listener, as it requires attention and patience to fully appreciate its complexity and depth. The album is, however, for the adventurous and curious listener, who is willing to explore new and unfamiliar territories of music and emotion. The album is a rewarding and enriching experience, that will leave the listener breathless and speechless.
