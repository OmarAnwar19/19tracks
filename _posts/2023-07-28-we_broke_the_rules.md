# We Broke the Rules by Aventura

We Broke the Rules is the second studio album by the American bachata group Aventura, released on July 2, 2002, by Premium Latin Music. The album features no guest appearances, and was produced by Aventura and Franklin Romero. The album was mainly recorded at The Lab Studios in New York City, using traditional instruments such as guitar, bongos, and maracas, as well as modern elements such as synthesizers, drum machines, and samples.

We Broke the Rules is a groundbreaking album that revolutionized the genre of bachata, by incorporating elements of pop, hip hop, and R&B into the Dominican folk music. The album also introduced a new style of bachata known as "the New York school", or "urban bachata", characterized by the inclusion of electric guitars instead of acoustic, and lyrics in Spanish and English instead of just Spanish. In addition, the singing style takes after R&B melodies. The album's themes mainly included love, romance, heartbreak, and social issues, such as in "Amor de Madre", or "Mother's Love", which is a song describing the lifelong struggle of a prostitute and her son. The album was a commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, and number 80 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album also spawned four singles, including the hit single "Obsesión", which topped the charts in several European countries, such as France, Italy, and Germany.

We Broke the Rules is a must-listen for any fan of Latin music, and a classic album that showcases Aventura's creativity, skill, and vision. The album is a feast of Aventura's catchy and clever lyrics, their diverse and eclectic beats, and their harmonious and expressive vocals. The album is also a journey through Aventura's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of their growth as a group and as individuals.
