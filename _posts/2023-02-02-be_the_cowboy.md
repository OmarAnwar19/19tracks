# Be the Cowboy by Mitski

Be the Cowboy is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Mitski, released on August 17, 2018, by Dead Oceans. The album is a follow-up to her 2016 album Puberty 2, which received universal acclaim from critics. The album features no guest appearances, and was produced by Mitski and Patrick Hyland. The album was mainly recorded at Retro City Studios in Philadelphia, Gradwell House in Haddon Heights, and Red Bull Studios in Los Angeles.

Be the Cowboy is a stunning showcase of Mitski's versatility, lyricism, and emotion. The album explores various themes such as love, loneliness, identity, and empowerment. The album also pays homage to Mitski's influences, such as Princess Diana, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of Mitski's most personal and introspective songs, such as "Geyser", "Nobody", and "Two Slow Dancers".

The album is not a collection of individual songs, but a unified whole that demands to be listened to from start to finish. The album takes the listener on a journey through Mitski's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of her growth as an artist and a person. The album is also a commentary on the state of modern society, and the challenges and struggles that women face in a patriarchal and oppressive world.

The album is not for the faint of heart, as it confronts some of the darkest and most painful aspects of human nature and experience. The album is also not for the casual listener, as it requires attention and patience to fully appreciate its complexity and depth. The album is, however, for the adventurous and curious listener, who is willing to explore new and unfamiliar territories of music and emotion. The album is a rewarding and enriching experience, that will leave the listener breathless and speechless.
