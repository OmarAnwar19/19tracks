# Starman by David Bowie

Starman is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on April 28, 1972, as the lead single from his fifth studio album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The song was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, and features Mick Ronson on guitar, Trevor Bolder on bass, and Mick Woodmansey on drums. The song also features a piano solo by Rick Wakeman, who later joined the progressive rock band Yes.

Starman is one of the most influential and iconic songs in the Bowie catalog, and in the history of rock music. The song is a sci-fi anthem that introduces the character of Ziggy Stardust, an alien rock star who comes to Earth to bring hope and inspiration to the youth. The song is also a homage to Bowie's influences, such as Princess Diana, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. The song has a cinematic feel, with a catchy chorus and a soaring bridge that create a sense of wonder and excitement.

The song was a breakthrough for Bowie, who had not had a hit single since 1969's Space Oddity. The song reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song also became a cultural phenomenon, thanks to Bowie's legendary performance on Top of the Pops on July 6, 1972, where he wore a flamboyant outfit and made a suggestive gesture with Ronson. The performance changed the course of music history, as it inspired and influenced generations of musicians, artists, and writers who saw it at the time and countless others who have since seen it over the decades, from bootleg VHS copies to YouTube clips.

Starman is a must-listen for any fan of rock music, and a timeless classic that transcends genres and eras. The song is a showcase of Bowie's creativity, skill, and vision, as well as his social and cultural awareness and commentary. The song is a journey through Bowie's life, thoughts, and feelings, and a reflection of his growth as an artist and a person.
