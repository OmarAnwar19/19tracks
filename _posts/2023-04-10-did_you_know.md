# Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd by Lana Del Rey

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, released on March 24, 2023, by Interscope Records. The album is a follow-up to her 2022 album Chemtrails over the Country Club, which received universal acclaim from critics. The album is named after a sign that Del Rey saw while driving to Long Beach, California, where she lived for a year and encountered nostalgia, romance, and mystery. The album features contributions from Jon Batiste, Bleachers, Father John Misty, Tommy Genesis, SYML and Riopy.

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is a stunning showcase of Del Rey's versatility, lyricism, and emotion. The album explores various themes such as love, loss, faith, identity, and heritage. The album also pays tribute to Del Rey's influences, such as Princess Diana, Kendrick Lamar, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive story. The album also features some of Del Rey's most personal and vulnerable songs, such as "Fingertips", "A&W", and "The Grants".

The album opens with "Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd", the lead single from the album, and one of the most catchy and memorable songs on the album. Del Rey sings over a groovy and funky beat, produced by El Guincho, that samples the 1980 disco song "Funkytown" by Lipps Inc. Del Rey showcases her melodic flow and poetic imagery, as she sings about her spiritual journey and her connection to nature. She also references her grandfather, who taught her how to play the piano and inspired her to pursue music. The track ends with a skit that introduces the concept of the album, as Del Rey is seen traveling to Long Beach and encountering a sign that says "Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd".

The next track is "A&W", the second single from the album, featuring Tommy Genesis, a Canadian rapper and singer. The track is a banger, with a catchy hook and energetic verses from both artists. The track is produced by Kaytranada, who provides a smooth and soulful beat that samples the 1977 soul song "I'm Your Boogie Man" by KC and the Sunshine Band. The track is a celebration of Del Rey's success and growth, as she raps about her achievements, aspirations, and lifestyle. She also shouts out her hometown, New York, and her label, Interscope. Tommy Genesis delivers an impressive verse as well, showcasing her chemistry and charisma.

The third track is "The Grants", the third single from the album, featuring Father John Misty, an American singer-songwriter and musician. The track is a ballad, with a melancholic piano and a mournful cello, that create a sense of sorrow and regret. Del Rey delivers a heartbreaking performance, as she sings about her failed relationship with a man who betrayed and abandoned her. She also references the Grants, a historical site where Ulysses S. Grant and his wife Julia lived in the 19th century, and where legend has it that they had a happy and faithful marriage. The track ends with a skit that shows Del Rey confronting her ex-lover, who denies any wrongdoing and blames her for everything.

The album closes with "Candy Necklace", the fourth single from the album, featuring Jon Batiste, an American musician and bandleader. The track is a duet, with a soaring and majestic piano and a bowed banjo, that create a sense of grandeur and glory. Del Rey delivers a stunning performance, as she sings about her hope and dream for the future. Its a strong closer for a great album.
