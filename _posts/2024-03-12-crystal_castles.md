# Crystal Castles by Crystal Castles

Crystal Castles is the debut studio album by Canadian electropunk duo Crystal Castles, released on March 18, 2008, by Lies Records, Last Gang Records, and Fiction Records. The album is a collection of tracks that the duo had previously released as singles or on various compilations, as well as some new and unreleased songs. The album features a blend of electropunk, electroclash, synth-pop, and witch house, with influences from Joy Division, Death from Above 1979, and Madonna. The album's themes mainly include the distortion and manipulation of sound, as well as love, violence, and alienation. The album also serves as an introduction to the duo's chaotic and lo-fi aesthetic, which they would further develop in their subsequent albums.

The album consists of 16 tracks, most of which are shorter than three minutes. The album opens with "Untrust Us", a glitchy and catchy track that features a sample of the 1983 post-punk song "She's Lost Control" by Joy Division. The track is produced by Ethan Kath, who provides a distorted and noisy beat that matches Alice Glass's vocals. Glass delivers a cryptic and mysterious performance, as she sings unintelligible lyrics that are heavily processed and manipulated. She also references her musical influences, such as Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The album then continues with "Alice Practice", a noisy and abrasive track that features a sample of the 2004 dance-punk song "Romantic Rights" by Death from Above 1979. The track is produced by Kath, who provides a harsh and aggressive beat that contrasts Glass's vocals. Glass delivers a frantic and angry performance, as she screams and shouts over the distorted and chaotic sounds. She also showcases her versatility, as she switches between singing and screaming.

The album then slows down with "Magic Spells", a melodic and dreamy track that features a sample of the 1989 pop song "Like a Prayer" by Madonna. The track is produced by Kath, who provides a sweet and soothing beat that samples the vocals, the keyboard, and the choir from the original song. The track is a solo performance by Kath, who sings about his love, his devotion, and his faith for a lover. He also pays tribute to his musical influences, such as Madonna and Depeche Mode.

The album then closes with "Tell Me What to Swallow", a soft and acoustic track that features a sample of the 1971 folk song "Wild Horses" by The Rolling Stones. The track is produced by Kath, who provides a gentle and minimal beat that samples the vocals, the guitar, and the strings from the original song. The track is a solo performance by Glass, who sings about her pain, her fear, and her submission to a lover. She also references her personal experiences, such as her abusive relationship and her self-harm.

The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the duo's chaotic and lo-fi aesthetic, as well as their diverse and eclectic sounds. The album was also a commercial success, reaching number 6 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart. The album also spawned three singles, "Crimewave", "Air War", and "Courtship Dating".

Crystal Castles is a must-listen for any fan of electropunk, and a classic album that showcases the duo's creativity, skill, and vision. The album features a blend of electropunk, electroclash, synth-pop, and witch house, with influences from Joy Division, Death from Above 1979, and Madonna. The album's themes mainly include the distortion and manipulation of sound, as well as love, violence, and alienation.
