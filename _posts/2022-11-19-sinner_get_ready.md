# Sinner Get Ready by Lingua Ignota

Sinner Get Ready is the fourth and final studio album by American musician Kristin Hayter, who performed under the name Lingua Ignota (Latin for "unknown language"). The album was released on August 6, 2021, by Sargent House. The album is a follow-up to her 2019 album Caligula, which received universal acclaim from critics. The album features no guest appearances, and was produced by Hayter and Seth Manchester. The album was mainly recorded at Machines with Magnets studio in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, using traditional instruments such as piano, banjo, cello, organ, bells, and psaltery.

Sinner Get Ready is a haunting and harrowing masterpiece of avant-garde music, and a testament to Hayter's talent and vision. The album is inspired by Hayter's experiences of living in rural Pennsylvania, where she encountered religious fanaticism, betrayal, and isolation. The album explores various themes such as faith, sin, judgment, redemption, and violence. The album also draws from Hayter's influences, such as classical music, Appalachian folk music, and evangelical hymns. The album has a cinematic feel, with skits, samples, and interludes that connect the songs and create a cohesive narrative. The album also features some of Hayter's most powerful and expressive vocals, ranging from angelic singing to demonic screaming.

The album opens with "The Order of Spiritual Virgins", a 9-minute epic that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Hayter sings over a sparse and eerie piano melody, that gradually builds up to a crescendo of dissonant chords and distorted vocals. Hayter delivers a chilling performance, as she sings about her devotion to God and her desire to be purified by fire. She also references the Order of the White Rose, a group of female mystics who practiced self-mutilation and extreme asceticism in the 13th century. The track ends with a skit that introduces the concept of the album, as Hayter is seen driving to Pennsylvania and encountering a sign that says "Sinner Get Ready".

The next track is "I Who Bend the Tall Grasses", a dark and atmospheric track that features a sample of the 1973 horror film The Wicker Man. Hayter sings over a droning organ and a pulsing bass, that create a sense of dread and tension. Hayter showcases her lyrical prowess, as she uses metaphors and imagery from nature to describe her relationship with God and her enemies. She also references the biblical story of Samson and Delilah, and the mythological figure of Medusa. The track ends with a skit that shows Hayter arriving at her new home, a dilapidated farmhouse.

The album concludes as strong as it starts, with the track is "The Solitary Brethren Of Ephrata", a folk-inspired track that features a bowed psaltery, a stringed instrument that produces a haunting sound. Hayter sings over a rhythmic and hypnotic melody, that creates a sense of urgency and desperation. Hayter delivers a passionate performance, as she sings about her struggle with faith and doubt, and her plea for God's mercy and guidance. She also references the Shakers, a religious sect that practiced celibacy, communal living, and ecstatic dancing. The track ends with a skit that shows Hayter finding a note that says "Many Hands Make Light Work".

Confetti is a good mixtape for any fan of hip hop, and a promising project for Jack Harlow. The mixtape is a showcase of Jack Harlow's versatility, lyricism, and charisma.
